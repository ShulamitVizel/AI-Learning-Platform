// This configuration file is for a TypeScript project that compiles to ES6 and uses CommonJS modules.
// It specifies the root directory for source files, the output directory for compiled files, and enables
// strict type checking and interoperability with ES modules. It also skips type checking for library files.
// The "include" field specifies the directories to include in the compilation process.
// The "prisma" directory is included to ensure that Prisma schema files are recognized during the
// compilation process, even though they are not TypeScript files.
// This setup is typical for a Node.js backend application using TypeScript and Prisma for database management.
// The "outDir" is set to "dist", which is a common convention for compiled output in TypeScript projects.
// The "rootDir" is set to "src", indicating that the source code is located in the "src" directory.
// The "skipLibCheck" option is used to skip type checking of declaration files, which can speed up the compilation process
// and reduce unnecessary errors related to third-party libraries.
// The "esModuleInterop" option allows for better compatibility with CommonJS modules, enabling the use of `import` statements for CommonJS modules.
// The "strict" option enables all strict type-checking options, which helps catch potential errors early in the development process.
//// This configuration is suitable for a modern TypeScript project that requires type safety and modularity,
// making it easier to maintain and scale the codebase.
// It is a good starting point for building a robust backend application using TypeScript and Prisma.
// The configuration can be further customized based on specific project requirements,
// such as adding paths for module resolution or configuring additional compiler options.
// The "include" array can also be modified to include other directories or files as needed.
// This setup is ideal for developers looking to leverage TypeScript's features in a Node.js environment
// while using Prisma for database interactions, providing a solid foundation for building scalable and maintainable applications.
// The configuration is designed to be flexible and can be adapted as the project evolves,
// allowing developers to add new features or change the structure of the codebase without significant rework
// to the TypeScript configuration.
